Revision history for Math-Utils

1.05
	25 Sep 2015
	- Bug in pl_derivative() for linear equation case.
	- Added test cases to cover it.
1.04
	20 Sep 2015
	- Bumped the version number everywhere but in the module
	  itself. This will probably complicate something, so
	  fix this everywhere with a version 1.04.
	- Add a flipsign() function to the :utility list.
	- More documention clean-up. Mention Math::VecStat
	  in the SEE ALSO.
1.03
	18 Sep 2015
	- Put :fortran tagged functions copysign() and log10()
	  in the :utility tagging. The :fortran tag sticks around
	  though.
	- New function pl_dxevaluate() for returning the y, dy,
	  d2y values of the polynomial at x.
	- New test files for pl_evaluate() and pl_dxevaluate().
1.02
	15 Sep 2015
	- Documentation error in pl_div() (mis-named variables
	  in the example).
	- Extended the SEE ALSO paragraph.
	- Very minor code clean-up in pl_antiderivative().
1.01
	5 Sep 2015
	- I had left test file 15-objcoeff.t off the MANIFEST list. Oops.
	- Embarrassing number of grammatical and spelling errors fixed.
	- Clarified a couple of examples, and extended the
	  pl_antiderivative() documentation with respect to the
	  constant term.
	- Version bump; up to CPAN.
1.00
	3 Sep 2015
	- Added the coefficient list functions for addition, subtraction,
	  division, multiplication, derivative, antiderivative,
	  and evaluation (via Horner's method) of polynomials without
	  actually creating a polynomial object.
	- Added the tests for the above operations.
0.02
	30 Aug 2015
	- CPAN testers caught a 5.10ism in the module, which is
	  listed as okay for version 5.8. Decided to bump the
	  minimum version requirement to 5.10.1.
	- Documentation was sketchy, so added more descriptive
	  text and examples.
	- Version bump; up to CPAN.
0.01
	18 Aug 2015
	- Collection of utility functions for Math modules, starting
	  with the functions of Math-Fortran as a base.
